# Binder Data

A place to store data for Binder. Analysis / description / etc should be done in other
repositories so that we can decouple data and code to analyze it!

`traffic/` contains a Python script to scrape the latest launch data from [archive.analytics.mybinder.org](https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org). It reads and writes from a [Parquet file](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) for efficient storage. It is meant to *update a pre-existing datastore* rather than download everything at once in order to save time.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is a GitHub workflow that regularly runs and scrapes the latest data using the script above, and publishes it as a GitHub release that we can share. It [publishes the data as a GitHub release here](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder-data/releases/tag/latest).

`analysis/` is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the data generated by `release.yml` and displays some visualizations and summary statistics, both to show off how to analyze the data, and to provide interesting information for people to understand what's going on with Binder. It is hosted as a [Jupyter Book 2 site](https://mystmd.org/guide) at http://hub.jupyter.org/binder-data/.
